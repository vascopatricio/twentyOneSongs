# twentyOneSongs

Song recommender for songs by the Twenty One Pilots using structured song data.

# What it is
A very simple song recommender and browser for songs by the Twenty One Pilots. It can plug in and out multiple technologies of your liking once they're implemented with one click.

# Status
Currently only Django is done both for frontend renderer and backend server. Next steps are Angular and React versions of the JavaScript frontend, and a Node.js version of the backend server. Also Firebase integration.

# Recommendation
Using good old business intelligence knowledge, the idea is that if we structure the songs using more dimensions than usual, we can provide a higher level of recommendation. I decided to add moods, instruments, pacing and other elements so we have more data dimensions for recommendation, which is viable for a small dataset of ~30 songs, and make an elite recommendation system for any song by the TÃ˜P.

# Data
I also open-sourced the data I manually input - both the actual database scaffolded by Django and JSON exports are available for you to use in any pet projects of your liking.
